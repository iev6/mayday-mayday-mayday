ONLY THE FIRST 5 LINES ARE READ. ANY COMMENTS MAY BE PLACED BELOW
note: on some systems, a space is required before the middle three
entries (lines 2-4).

First item is a 10 character string for DATE: yyyy/mm/dd
   for monthly average use dd = 00
   NOTE: include the zeros for months and days 
         (use 1998/04/01, do not use 1998/4/1)   

Second is integer HOUR
   for daily average use HOUR = 0, 
   This variable is ignored if dd = 00

Third is integer for PARTICLE
             CASE(0)        PARTICLE= TOTAL (see below)     
             CASE(1)        PARTICLE= NEUTRONS   
             CASE(2)        PARTICLE= PHOTONS    
             CASE(3)        PARTICLE= ELECTRONS  
             CASE(4)        PARTICLE= POSITRONS

             CASE(8)        PARTICLE= NEG PIONS  
             CASE(9)        PARTICLE= POS PIONS  
             CASE(10)       PARTICLE= DEUTERONS  
             CASE(11)       PARTICLE= TRITONS

             CASE(18)       PARTICLE= NITROGEN   
             CASE(19)       PARTICLE= OXYGEN     
             CASE(20)       PARTICLE= FLUORINE   
             CASE(21)       PARTICLE= NEON       
             CASE(22)       PARTICLE= SODIUM     
             CASE(23)       PARTICLE= MAGNESIUM  
             CASE(24)       PARTICLE= ALUMINUM   
             CASE(25)       PARTICLE= SILICON    
             CASE(26)       PARTICLE= PHOSPHORUS 
             CASE(27)       PARTICLE= SULPHUR    
             CASE(28)       PARTICLE= CHLORINE   
             CASE(29)       PARTICLE= ARGON

             CASE(31)       PARTICLE= CALCIUM    
             CASE(32)       PARTICLE= SCANDIUM   
             CASE(33)       PARTICLE= TITANIUM   
             CASE(34)       PARTICLE= VANADIUM   
             CASE(35)       PARTICLE= CHROMIUM   
             CASE(36)       PARTICLE= MANGANESE  
             CASE(37)       PARTICLE= IRON       
             
Fourth item is integer TALLY
             CASE(1) secondary particle fluence (if particle 
                     is 'TOTAL', then output is total ion fluence,
                     which excludes neutrons and photons.)            
             CASE(2) microSv, ICRP Pub. 103 EFFECTIVE DOSE 
             CASE(3) microSv, ICRP Pub. 60 EFFECTIVE DOSE  
             CASE(4) microSv, ICRU AMBIENT DOSE EQ. H(*10) 
             CASE(5) microGy, AVE WHOLE-BODY ABSORBED DOSE 

Fifth item is the name of the file to process: *.DEG or *.BIG or other.
             Name length must be less than 30 characters with no spaces and a 
             3-letter extension (e.g. EXAMPLE.BIG or MYPLACES.DAT):            
             if the extension is DEG then the program will process flight file like CARI-6M, 
                    i.e., outputs will be in *.SUM (short form) and *.DAT (long form);
             if BIG then the program will process the flight file like CARI-6, 
                    i.e., output will be in *.OUT;
             otherwise the program attempts to process the file as a locations definition file,
                    i.e., output will be in *.ans.
             Of course, garbage in will lead to either garbage out or a crash.                      
                    
TO CHANGE OTHER OPTIONS EDIT THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE 'CARI.INI' 
(USE A TEXT EDITOR OR START CARI-7 AND SELECT MAIN MENU OPTION 6, THEN OPTION 1).

VIEWER    = gedit         !DEFAULT FILE VIEWER FOR OUTPUT, PICK ANY TEXT EDITOR
OUTPUT    = FILE          !DEFAULT DESTINATION OF OUTPUT (FILE, SCRN, BOTH)
DIAGNOSE  = NO!           !DEFAULT DIAGNOSTIC OUTPUT SETTING, CHANGE TO YES FOR CALCULATIONS DETAILS

DISPLAY   = DOS           !HOW TO DISPLAY MENUS: DOS OR GUI. (GUI NOT CODED, DON'T USE IT!)
MENUS     = NO!           !DEFAULT IS TO HAVE INTERNAL MENUS. CHANGE TO 'NO!' TO USE DATA FROM DEFAULT.INP
SUPERPOS  = NO!           !* DEFAULT IS 'NO!', CHANGE TO 'YES' TO USE SUPERPOSITION APPROXIMATION
GCR_MODEL = 4             !* 1=ISO, 2=BO11, 3=BO11**, 4=ISO***, 5=LaRCFeb56SPE, 6=LaRCSep89SPE, 7=MY_SPEC.OUT

NOTES:
DO NOT CHANGE THE FORMAT OF THIS FILE ABOVE "END"!!! EACH LINE IS A10,A2,A12 THROUGH END.

*  These option are only meaningful in CARI-7A, and cannot be changed in CARI-7. CARI-7 always uses
   SUPERPOS  = NO! 
   GCR_MODEL = 4    ! Also, in CARI-7 (but not 7A) 150 MV is added to CARI-6 heliocentric potential at runtime  
   NVCR      = 0    ! The influence of non-vertical cutoff rigidities is always included using the 
                      approximate flux modulation: phi=phi*0.01*(100.-VC*1.5).   

1. VEIWER EXPECTED COMMAND FORM IS 'VIEWER FILE_TO_OPEN', FOR LINUX/UNIX SYSTEMS './' IS NOT NEEDED SINCE
   OS RELATED CHANGES WILL HANDLE THAT SWITCH, BUT THE PROGRAM NAME COULD BE CASE SENSITIVE! ALSO, SELECTION
   IN VIEWER DESIGNATES WHICH PROGRAM IS CALLED FOR EDITING/VIEWING EXTERNAL FILES AT RUNTIME.
2. ONLY FILE WORKS RIGHT NOW, OUTPUT DIRECTLY TO THE SCREEN AND TO BOTH ARE NOT YET CODED! 
3. DIAGNOSE SETS INTERNAL DIAGNOSTIC PRINTING FOR ROUTINES NOT UNDER MANUAL CONTROL IN THE SOURCE CODE, SET TO  
   'YES' FOR MASSIVE OUTPUT IN FILES 'DIAGNOSE\CARI7CHK.DAT','DIAGNOSE\DIAGDAP.DAT',ETC. RUN TIMES WILL BE 
   INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.  
4. SELECTS THE OPERATING SYSTEM: WINDOWS/DOS OR OTHER (I.E., LINUX/UNIX). THIS CHANGES PATH IN SYSTEM CALLS,
   AS WELL AS ANY OS FILE MANIPULATION COMMANDS NOT AVAILBLE TO THE STD COMPILER. WINDOWS AND LINUX PATHS TO 
   FILES AND COMMANDS ARE ENCODED. SOME TWEAKING OF SOURCE CODE MAY BE NEEDED FOR OTHER OSes.
5. DISPLAY SELECTS THE USER INTERFACE: DOS (COMMAND PROMPT SHELL) OR GUI (NOT YET AVAILABLE)
6. TOGGLES INTERNAL MENUS. STARTING THE PROGRAM WITH THIS OPTION = 'NO!' WILL RESULT IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
   ANALYZE THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE NAMED AT LINE 5 IN DEFAULT.INP. IF THE FILE IS A .BIG OR .DEG FLIGHT DATA   
   FILE AND THE DATE = '0000/00/00', THEN DATES IN THE FLIGHT DATA FILE WILL BE USED, BUT OTHER RUN OPTIONS
   WILL BE CONTROLLED BY THE DEFAULT.INP AND CARI.INI CONTENTS. FOR LOCATION DATA FILES THE DATE AND OPTIONS   
   IN DEFAULT.INP ARE IGNORED, THE PROGRAM ALWAYS USES THE DATA IN THE NAMED FILE. FILENAMES ARE LIMITED TO 
   LESS THAN 30 CHARACTERS. NORMAL OUTPUT FILES ARE PRODUCED: 
         FOR *.BIG RESULTS WILL BE IN *.OUT
         FOR *.DEG A SUMMARY WILL BE IN *.SUM AND A LONGER REPORT IN *.DAT
         FOR A LOCATION FILE (THE NAME OF THE LOCATION DATA FILE CAN HAVE ANY 3-CHAR EXTENSION EXCEPT 'DEG' OR
         'BIG', IF .LOC IS USED, THEN WHEN MENUS = 'YES' IT WILL BE AVAILABLE AS AN OPTION) THE RESULTS WILL BE 
         IN *.ANS .

These codes are all written in structured Fortran95. The codes written
by me may be freely distributed. Those not written by me are:

1. The subroutines in GEODESIC.FOR, which are adapted for use from 
the package FORWARD/INVERSE, freely distributed by the US National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Geodetic Survey 
(https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/); 

2. The cubic spline routine TDSPLINE is adapted from a routine 
published in 2008 for open use by Tanmoy Das at his codes blog 
(http://encodedcode.blogspot.com/2008/10/spline-interpolation-
function-for.html). It resembles:

with thier comments removed, but variable names and code layout
are identical, with the exception that TD combines SPLINE and SPLINT
into one sub.
